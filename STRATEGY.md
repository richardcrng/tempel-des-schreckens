# Strategy

Part of the charm of a game like *Tempel des Schreckens* is figuring out and trying different strategies (which works really nicely, because games are so quick).

As such, here, I share some *very basic* tips and strategies that I might share with people when I'm teaching them the game - but **these are not meant to be prescriptive or definitive strategies**. These guidelines are designed for you to experiment with (and break), so that you can figure out your own strategy.

(These tips and strategies are intended for people who are not veterans of social deduction games like Mafia/Werewolf, Insider, The Resistance, *etc.* - if you have played lots of games like that, you don't need these tips.)

## Adventurer strategies

A default rule of thumb is: *be truthful* in what you claim about your distribution.

This is useful for two reasons:

Firstly, if all Adventurers are truthful, **you're better placed to make decisions about which Chambers to open**, so as to maximise your odds of Gold.

Secondly, if all Adventurers are truthful, **you have a tool to identify Guardians** - catching somebody whose flipped cards are inconsistent with what they had claimed!

It is useful to also *check for discrepancies* in cards reported. For example, suppose you know that there are meant to be 5 Golds in play, but there are *7 Golds reported* - this is a sign that something fishy is going on...!

(There are some situations where it is sensible to not be truthful - as you play the game more, you will likely figure these out. As a novice player, you're probably best off trying to be truthful as a strong default if you are an Adventurer.)

## Guardian strategies

The most important tip is to *be subtle*. You lose a lot of your power to deceive and mislead the Adventurers if you are easily identified as such. (If you have 0 Gold, 1 Fire and 3 Empties, but you claim 5 Gold, you will probably be relatively swiftly identified as a Guardian.)

(There are some situations where you might deliberately seek to get yourself outed as a Guardian - as you play the game more, you will likely figure these out. As a novice player, you're probably best off trying to be subtle as a strong default if you are a Guardian.)

## General conventions

I find it is convenient to establish a convention where you *don't bother reporting Empty chambers*. Empty chambers are both the most populous and the least interesting - so, take them as a default, and report deviations from that.

For example, suppose you have 5 cards, which are 1 Gold, 4 Empties and 0 Fire. If I were reporting truthfully, I would report this as "1 Gold, no Fire", or even just "1 Gold".
- If I report "1 Gold, no Fire", there's an implied "and the remaining 4 cards are all Empty"
- If I report "1 Gold", it can be inferred that I'm not claiming Fire (otherwise I would have claimed "1 Gold, X Fire")

This convention makes it easier to keep track of who is claiming what, by having fewer numbers in the mix. (You only need to keep track of two claimed numbers per player, as opposed to three.)
