      <h1>ðŸ‘¹ Tempel des Schreckens</h1>
      <h3>A quick-playing bluffing game for 3-10 players.</h3>
      <p>
        You've finally reached the Temple of Secrets with its immense treasure
        of gold â€” but what awaits you here? Fabulous wealth or total
        destruction? The proud and mysterious temple guards who are hiding
        amongst the adventurers are trying to lure them onto the wrong track in
        order to protect their gold. Skillfully and with a deceitful tongue,
        they try to convince you to open the grave chambers behind which lies a
        dangerous fire trap. Can you trust anyone in the group when you don't
        know whether they're friend or foe?
