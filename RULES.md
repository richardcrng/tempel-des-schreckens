# Rules

> ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª *Tempel des Schreckens* has official rules that only exist in German - so my understanding of the game is significantly indebted to [this unofficial English translation](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/139993/tempel-des-schreckens-unofficial-rules-english) of the rules.

**Welcome to the *Tempel des Schreckens*!**

## Thematic setup

For decades, rumours have spread about a hidden temple of great treasures... and grave terrors.

A foolhardy group of **Adventurers** have stumbled across it - and now they're ready to ransack it for all that it's worth.

However, some mysterious Temple **Guardians** have been awoken from their slumber, stirred to protect the treasures within.

Can the Adventurers find all the temple's gold in time? Or will they be led astray by the Guardians - into deadly traps of fire, or sealed within the temple for all eternity?

## Roles and win conditions

There are two possible teams in *Tempel des Schreckens*, Adventurers and Guardians. Every game always has a single winning team.

Firstly, **Adventurer**. There is only one way that you can win: if all of the temple's **Gold** is opened within four rounds.

Secondly, **Guardian**. There are two different ways that you can win:
1. If four rounds pass to completion *without* all of the Gold being located; or
2. If, at any time, all of the temple's **Fire** traps are opened.

The game ends in three ways:
1. *All Gold has been opened* - Adventurers win
2. *All Fire has been opened* - Guardians win
3. *Four rounds are complete* - Guardians win

In other words:
- Adventurers are in a race against time to find all the Gold before the end of four rounds
- Guardians can try to obstruct Adventurers in two ways (not mutually exclusive):
  - Leading them into dangerous Fire traps
  - Stalling them so Adventurers run out of time
