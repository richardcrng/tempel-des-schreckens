# Rules

> ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª *Tempel des Schreckens* has official rules that only exist in German - so my understanding of the game is significantly indebted to [this unofficial English translation](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/139993/tempel-des-schreckens-unofficial-rules-english) of the rules.

**Welcome to the *Tempel des Schreckens*!**

## Thematic setup

For decades, rumours have spread about a hidden temple of great treasures... and grave terrors.

A foolhardy group of **Adventurers** have stumbled across it - and now they're ready to ransack it for all that it's worth.

However, some mysterious Temple **Guardians** have been awoken from their slumber, stirred to protect the treasures within.

Can the Adventurers find all the temple's gold in time? Or will they be led astray by the Guardians - into deadly traps of fire, or sealed within the temple for all eternity?

## Roles and win conditions

### Hidden roles and teams

In *Tempel des Schreckens*, **roles are always secret**. You know your role, but you don't know anybody else's role - and so you don't know who is, or who is not, on your team.

But, like a lot of hidden role games, there is a large *social deduction* element of trying to identify who is on which team.

There are exactly **two teams**: Adventurers and Guardians.
- *Teams are in direct competition* - every game always has a single winning team.
- *Teammates are non-competitive* - when a team wins, all of its members win together.

### Team win conditions

The two teams have different win conditions, which are directly opposed to each other.

The **Adventurer** team wins in only one way: if all of the temple's **Gold** is opened within four rounds.

The **Guardian** team wins in one of two ways:
1. If four rounds pass to completion *without* all of the Gold being located; or
2. If, at any time, all of the temple's **Fire** traps are opened.

The game ends in three ways:
1. *All Gold has been opened* - Adventurers win
2. *All Fire has been opened* - Guardians win
3. *Four rounds are complete* - Guardians win

There is always a winning team at the end of the game.

### Basic team dynamics

Adventurers are in a race against time to find all the Gold before the end of four rounds. They will try to cooperate with each other and share information to help them locate the Gold.

Guardians will obstruct this by *pretending* to be Adventurers (remember: roles are secret), and spreading misinformation, with two methods of obstruction (non-mutually exclusive):
- *Luring:* leading Adventurers into dangerous Fire traps
- *Stalling:* leading Adventurers down rabbit holes so that time runs out

However, if Guardians aren't subtle, Adventurers may be able to *deduce* their identity, and thus discount their misinformation.

## Game mechanics

### Chamber cards

The *Tempel des Schreckens* is organised into distinct Chambers, each of which is represented by a **Chamber card**.

As the game progresses, the temple gets explored, and more chambers get *opened* - represented by flipping the card from face-down (unopened) to face-up (opened).

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around;">
  <div style="width: 150">
    <img alt="Tempel des Schreckens - unopened chamber" src="./client/public/assets/tds-chamber.jpeg" width="150" />
    <p>Unopened chamber (back)</p>
  </div>
  <div style="width: 150">
    <img alt="Tempel des Schreckens - gold chamber" src="./client/public/assets/tds-gold.jpeg" width="150" />
    <p>Gold chamber (opened, front)</p>
  </div>
  <div style="width: 150">
    <img alt="Tempel des Schreckens - fire chamber" src="./client/public/assets/tds-fire.jpeg" width="150" />
    <p>Fire chamber (opened, front)</p>
  </div>
  <div style="width: 150">
    <img alt="Tempel des Schreckens - empty chamber" src="./client/public/assets/tds-empty.jpeg" width="150" />
    <p>Empty chamber (opened, front)</p>
  </div>
</div>

All unopened chambers look identical.

When chambers are opened (flipped), they have three possible things they might reveal:
- **Gold**: good news for Adventurers, that's one closer to victory!
- **Fire**: bad news for Adventurers, that's one closer to defeat...
- **Empty**: neutral-*ish*, at least it's not fire...

Whilst empty chambers don't count towards either gold or fire (and so they are neutral-*ish*), they *do* count towards the ticking time clock, as discussed in the next section.
